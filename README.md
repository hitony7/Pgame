# Path Finder

I decided to create a path finder visualer in python. 
Which will show the shortest path between two points on a graph.

##### Goals of this Project
1) Improve my python(I haven't done python since my intro course @UOFC CPSC 231).
    a) Learn Tkinter(default graphic library)
2) Refresh my Understanding of Graphs (data structures and algorithms)

### What I'm using to create this project
- VSCODE is my current choice of IDE 
- Extensions: Git History, Git Lens, Python EXT
- Running on Python 3.2.0 32-Bit
